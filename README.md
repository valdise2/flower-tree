# flower-tree
This project involved using a decision tree to address a classification problem. 
The goal of the project was to determine a flower's species based on its features. 
The model was trained, and predictions were then made (with an accuracy of 97.3%) on the test data.
The optimal max_depth of the decision tree was determined to be 3. 
Therefore, the decision tree had 3 splits before coming to a decision.
